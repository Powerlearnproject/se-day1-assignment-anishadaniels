List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to building software. It involves a series of phases that ensure the software is developed efficiently, effectively, and meets the desired requirements.

Phases of the SDLC:

Planning:

This phase involves defining the project's goals, scope, and requirements.
It also includes creating a project plan, allocating resources, and identifying potential risks.

Requirements Analysis:

In this phase, the specific needs and expectations of the software are gathered and documented.
This involves conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops with stakeholders to understand their requirements.
Design:

The design phase involves creating a blueprint for the software's architecture, components, and interactions.
It includes creating diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual representations to communicate the design to the development team.

Development:

This is where the actual coding of the software takes place.
The development team follows the design specifications to build the software components.
Testing:

Once the software is developed, it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix defects.
This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

Deployment:

After testing, the software is deployed to the production environment.
This involves installing the software on servers or other hardware.

Maintenance:

The maintenance phase involves ongoing activities to ensure the software continues to function properly.
This includes providing support, addressing issues, and making enhancements as needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology
The Waterfall model is a linear sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next can begin. It's often likened to a waterfall, as progress flows from one phase to the next.

Key Characteristics:

Sequential: Phases are executed in order.
Rigid: Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is complete.
Detailed Planning: Requires upfront planning and documentation.
Predictable: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a stable environment.
Example:

Building a bridge: The construction of a bridge involves a series of well-defined steps (planning, design, construction, testing) that must be completed in order.
Agile Methodology
Agile methodologies emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. They focus on delivering working software in short cycles (sprints) and adapting to changes as they arise.

Key Characteristics:

Iterative: Development is broken down into smaller cycles.
Flexible: Can adapt to changing requirements.
Collaborative: Involves frequent communication and feedback.
Customer-Centric: Prioritizes delivering value to customers.
